  "changes": {
    "Major features (1.9.7)": "No new features in this release, but the music engine has been migrated from wavelink.py to lavalink.py internally due to the former being unmaintained now. This should result in better stability with music in addition to Lavalink getting its own dedicated pod now.",
    "Internal Updates (1.9.7)": "Migrated to Google Kubernetes Engine and a fully integrated CI/CD pipeline for Roti! So hopefully no more annoying last-minute manual VM fixes.",
    "Bug Fixes (1.9.7)": "-Fixed bug where AI responses just..stopped working.\n-Fixed bug where MOTD shuffling stopped working."
